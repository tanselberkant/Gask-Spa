# Genc Ankaralılar Sk 

My aim was to make a new website for my friend who is coaching in "Genç Ankaralılar Spor Kulübü". It was an enjoyable opportunity for me as someone who also served in the ice hockey national team. I can say that my love for ice hockey helped me reinforce my Angular and c# knowledge. 

## Technologies That I Used
Angular /  .Net Core / Jwt / emailJs / AlertifyJs / Bootstrap
